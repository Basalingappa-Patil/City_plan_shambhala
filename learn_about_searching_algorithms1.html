	<h3 class="MsoNormal">Common Searching Algorithms:<o:p></o:p></h3>
	<h4>Linear Search:</h4>
	<p><span>Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm that scans each 
	element of a list until the desired element is found or the list ends. It is 
	straightforward but can be inefficient for large lists as its time 
	complexity is O(n).</span></p>
	<h4>Brute Force String Search:</h4>
	<p><span>Brute Force String Search is a straightforward method for finding a 
	substring (pattern) in a string (text). It checks for the pattern at every 
	position in the text one by one. While simple to implement, it can be slow 
	with a time complexity of O(mn), where m is the length of the pattern and n 
	is the length of the text.</span></p>
	<h4>Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:</h4>
	<p><span>The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm improves the search 
	efficiency by preprocessing the pattern to create a partial match table 
	(also known as the "lps" array) that allows the algorithm to skip 
	unnecessary comparisons. This results in a time complexity of O(n), making 
	it significantly faster than brute force for larger texts.</span></p>
	<h4>Boyer-Moore Algorithm:</h4>
	<p><span>The Boyer-Moore algorithm is one of the most efficient string 
	searching algorithms. It preprocesses the pattern to create two tables: the 
	"bad character rule" and the "good suffix rule." These tables help the 
	algorithm skip sections of the text, reducing the number of comparisons. The 
	average-case time complexity is O(n/m), making it extremely efficient for 
	large texts.</span></p>
