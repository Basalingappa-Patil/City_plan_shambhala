	  Hierarchies</span></h2>
      <p>Tree data structures are fundamental in computer science for managing 
	  hierarchical data efficiently. They offer various ways to organize and 
	  access data, ensuring quick search, insertion, and deletion operations. 
	  Common types of tree data structures include Binary Search Trees (BST), 
	  AVL trees, Red-Black trees, 2-3 trees, heaps, and tries. Each type has 
	  unique properties that make it suitable for specific scenarios, such as 
	  maintaining balance, optimizing search times, or handling prefix-based 
	  searches. Collectively, these structures are essential for tasks like 
	  database indexing, priority queues, autocomplete systems, and more, 
	  providing the backbone for efficient algorithm design and data management 
	  in numerous applications</p>
	  <p>Hierarchical data structures are pivotal in organizing and managing data that naturally forms a hierarchy, such as file systems, organizational charts, and classification systems. Trees are a classic example of hierarchical data structures, and different types of trees are designed to solve and optimize specific problem scenarios.<br><span>

      <h3 class="text-left">General Tree</h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span>A tree is a collection of nodes connected by 
		edges, with one node designated as the root. Each node can have zero or 
		more child nodes, and there is no limit to the number of children a node 
		can have.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It is used to represent hierarchical data like file 
		systems,organizational structures.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It provides a flexible way to model data that 
		doesn't fit into a strict linear order.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="text-left">Binary Search Tree</h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span>A BST is a type of tree where each node has 
		at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. For any 
		given node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's 
		value, and all values in the right subtree are greater.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It is used for efficiently searching, inserting, and deleting data, such as in databases and 
		dynamic sets.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">BST is prefered as a better data structure since it<span> 
		ensures that operations like search, insert, and delete can be performed 
		in O(log n) time on average, making it suitable for applications 
		requiring dynamic data management.</span></p>
    </section>
     <section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="text-left"><span>AVL Tree</span></h3>
         <p class="MsoNormal"><span>
		 <o:p>An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the 
		 difference in heights of the left and right subtrees of any node is at 
		 most one. This balance is maintained through rotations during insertion 
		 and deletion operations.</o:p></span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal"><span>It is used in situations where balanced tree 
		 performance is critical, such as in search operations and database 
		 indexing.</span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-add-space: auto;">
		 AVL trees provide guaranteed O(log n) time complexity for insert, 
		 delete, and search operations, ensuring consistent performance.</span></p>

   <section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="text-left">2-3<span> TREE</span></h3>
         <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-add-space: auto;">
		 <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A 2-3 tree is a type of balanced search 
		 tree where every node has either two or three children. It maintains 
		 balance by ensuring that all leaf nodes are at the same depth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal"><span>It is used for filesystem 
		 implementation,datatbase indexing and memory management.</span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-add-space: auto;">
		 <span>The strict balancing criteria ensure that the tree remains 
		 balanced, providing efficient search, insert, and delete operations.</span></p>
    </section>
    
   <section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="text-left">Red-Black Tree</h3>
	   <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-add-space: auto;"><span lang="EN-IN">A 
	   red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node 
	   contains an extra bit for denoting the color (red or black). The tree 
	   ensures that no two consecutive red nodes appear on any path from the 
	   root to the leaves, and the number of black nodes is consistent on every 
	   path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Used in the implementation of associative 
		 arrays, priority queues, and sets/maps in many programming languages.</span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-add-space: auto;">
		 <span>Red-black trees offer good balance with less strict balancing 
		 criteria compared to AVL trees, leading to simpler implementation while 
		 still ensuring O(log n) performance for basic operations.</span></p>
    </section>

   <section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="text-left">Heap</h3>
	   <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-add-space: auto;"><span lang="EN-IN">
	   <o:p><span>A heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies 
	   the heap property, where the key at the root must be either the largest 
	   or the smallest among all keys present in the tree (max-heap or 
	   min-heap).</span></o:p></span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Used in the implementation of </span>
		 <span lang="EN-IN">Priority queues, scheduling algorithms, and graph 
		 algorithms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-add-space: auto;">
		 <span lang="EN-IN">Heaps provide efficient access to the largest or 
		 smallest element, making them ideal for priority queue implementations 
		 and algorithms that need frequent access to extreme values.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="text-left">Trie</h3>
	   <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-add-space: auto;"><span lang="EN-IN">A 
	   trie (or prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic 
	   set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. Each node represents 
	   a common prefix of the stored strings.</span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Used in the implementation of Autocomplete 
		 systems, spell checkers, and IP routing.</span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-add-space: auto;">
		 <span lang="EN-IN">Tries offer efficient string search operations, 
		 allowing for quick lookups, insertions, and deletions, making them 
		 suitable for applications that involve large sets of strings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
