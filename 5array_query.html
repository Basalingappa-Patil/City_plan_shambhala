      <h2 class="text-center">Array Query Algorithms</h2>
	  <p>Array query algorithms are essential tools in computer science that allow for efficient retrieval and manipulation of data stored in arrays. These algorithms are designed to perform operations such as searching, updating, and computing aggregate values over array elements. Their principles and applications highlight their importance in various fields.</p>
		<p>An array query involves performing specific operations on an array to retrieve or update information based on certain conditions.
    Common Operations: These include finding the minimum or maximum value, summing elements, checking for the presence of a value, and updating elements at particular indices.
</p></section>
<section>
		<h3>Principles</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>&nbsp;Efficiency: Array query algorithms aim to minimize the time complexity of these operations, ensuring quick and efficient access to data.
    		</li>
			<li>Optimization: Techniques such as pre-processing, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming are often used to optimize the performance of these algorithms.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Implications
    </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Performance: Efficient array query algorithms can significantly improve the performance of applications, especially those that handle large datasets. Reducing the time complexity of common operations allows for faster data retrieval and processing.</li>
			<li>&nbsp;Scalability: As datasets grow, scalable array query algorithms ensure that performance remains manageable. This is crucial in big data applications and real-time systems where quick access to data is essential.
    		</li>
			<li>Resource Management: Optimized algorithms help manage computational resources effectively, reducing memory usage and computational overhead.
