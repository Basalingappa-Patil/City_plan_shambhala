           <p>In the realm of problem-solving and computer science, three key 
	  concepts stand out for their efficiency: iteration, 
	  recursion, and backtracking. Iteration involves repeatedly executing a set 
	  of instructions, making it invaluable for tasks like data processing and 
	  looping structures. Recursion breaks down complex problems into simpler, 
	  manageable parts by allowing functions to call themselves, often leading 
	  to more intuitive and cleaner solutions. Backtracking, on the other hand, 
	  systematically explores potential solutions and retreats when a dead-end 
	  is encountered, making it essential for solving puzzles and optimization 
	  problems. Together, these techniques form the backbone of many algorithms, 
	  enabling us to tackle a wide array of challenges with precision and 
	  creativity.</p>

      <h3 class="text-left">Iteration</h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Iteration is a process where a set of 
		instructions is repeated in a sequence until a specific condition is 
		met. It involves looping constructs like for or while loops in 
		programming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Example: Counting from 1 to 10 by adding 1 
		repeatedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Iteration can be better understood with the 
		example of automated financial system,where tasks need to be repeated 
		regularly to maintain,update and process data efficiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="text-left">Recursion</h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Recursion is a method where a function calls 
		itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem by breaking it down 
		into smaller sub-problems. This approach continues until a base 
		condition is met.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Example: Calculating the factorial of a 
		number, where fact(n) = n * fact(n-1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">This can be better understood with the example of 
		towers of Hanoi problem. The goal is to move all the disks from the 
		source rod to the destination rod, following these rules:<o:p></o:p></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only one disk 
			can be moved at a time.<o:p></o:p></p>

			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A disk can only 
			be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty rod.<o:p></o:p></p>

			<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Disks can only 
			be moved to adjacent rods.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

    </section>
     <section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="text-left">Backtracking</h3>
         <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Backtracking is a technique for solving 
		 problems by exploring all possible options and abandoning those that 
		 fail to meet the criteria, retreating (backtracking) to previous steps 
		 to try other paths.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal"><span>A basic example to understand the concept of 
		 backtracking is solving Sudoku puzzles by trying numbers and 
		 backtracking when a conflict is found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		 <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Example: Solving a maze by exploring 
		 different paths and backtracking when a dead end is reached until the 
		 exit is found.</span></p>

	  searches. Collectively, these structures are essential for tasks like 
	  database indexing, priority queues, autocomplete systems, and more, 
	  providing the backbone for efficient algorithm design and data management 
	  in numerous applications</p>
	  <p>Hierarchical data structures are pivotal in organizing and managing data that naturally forms a hierarchy, such as file systems, organizational charts, and classification systems.

  <h3>Techniques</h3>
	  <h4>Brute Force</h4>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Brute force is a straight forward approach to solving a problem, 
	  usually, directly based on the problem statement and definitions of the 
	  concepts involved. </p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Basically it’s an exhaustive algorithm. Example: a brute force 
	  algorithm to find the divisors of a natural number ‘n’ would enumerate all 
	  integers from 1 to n and check whether each of them divides n without 
	  reminders.</p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>Selection Sort</li>
		   <li>Bubble Sort
	   </li>
		   <li>Sequential Search</li>
		   <li>Brute Force String Match <br></li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  
	  
		  <h4>Decrease and Conquer</h4>
	 
	  <p class="auto-style1">It is based on exploiting the relationship between a solution to a 
	  given instance of a problem and solution to a smaller instance of the same 
	  problem. </p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Once the relation is established, it can be either exploited by 
	  top-down approach using recursion or bottom-up approach without recursion.</p>
	  <p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;The technique has variations: </p>
	  <ul class="auto-style2">
		  <li>Decrease by a constant </li>
		  <li>Decrease by a constant factor</li>
		  <li>Variable size decrease </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>Insertion Sort</li>
		   <li>Depth First Search</li>
		   <li>Breadth First Search</li>
	  </ul>
	  
			  <h4>Divide and Conquer</h4>
	  
	  <p class="auto-style1">The technique is based on based on multi-branched 
	  recursion. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking 
	  down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, 
	  until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to 
	  the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original 
	  problem. </p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>Merge Sort</li>
		   <li>Quick Sort
	   </li>
		   <li>Binary Search</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	 
			  <h4>Transform and Conquer</h4>
	  
	  <p class="auto-style1">A problem instance is transformed to one of the 
	  below before the solution is obtained. </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li class="auto-style1">
		  Instance simplification: transform to a simpler or more convenient 
		  instance of the same problem.<li class="auto-style1">
		  Representation change: transform to a different representation of the 
		  same instance.<li class="auto-style1">
		  Problem reduction: transform to an instance of 
		  a different problem for which an algorithm is already available.</ul>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>AVL Trees&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
		   <li>2-3 Trees</li>
		   <li>Heap Sort</li>
	  </ul>

			  <h4>Dynamic Programming</h4>
	  
	  <p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;Dynamic programming is a method for solving a 
	  complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler 
	  sub-problems, solving each of those sub-problems just once, and storing 
	  their solutions. The next time the same sub-problem occurs, instead of 
	  recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed 
	  solution, thereby saving computation time at the expense of a modest 
	  expenditure in storage space. </p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">The technique of storing solutions to subproblems 
	  instead of recomputing them is called "memoization". Dynamic programming 
	  algorithms are often used for optimization. A dynamic programming 
	  algorithm will examine the previously solved subproblems and will combine 
	  their solutions to give the best solution for the given problem.</p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>Warshall's Algorithm</li>
		   <li>Floyd's Algorithm</li>
		   <li>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</li>
	  </ul>

			  <h4>Greedy Technique</h4>
	  
	  <p class="MsoNormal">A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that 
	  follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice 
	  at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">In general, greedy algorithms have five components:<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <ul>
		  <li class="auto-style1">
		  A candidate set, from which a solution is created<o:p>.</o:p><li class="auto-style1">
		  <o:p>A selection function,<span>which chooses the best candidate to be 
		  added to the solution.</span></o:p><li class="auto-style1">
		  <p class="MsoNormal">A feasibility function, that is used to determine 
		  if a candidate can be used to<o:p> contribute to a solution.</o:p></p>
		  <li class="auto-style1">
		  <p class="MsoNormal">An objective function, which assigns a value to a 
		  solution, or a partial solution, and</p>
		  <li class="auto-style1">
		  <p class="MsoNormal">A solution function, which will indicate when we 
		  have discovered a complete<o:p> solution</o:p></p>
		  <o:p></o:p>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>Prim's Algorithm</li>
		   <li>Kruskal's Algorithm</li>
		   <li>Dijkstra's Algorithm</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h4>Space and Time trade-off</h4>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">A space–time or time–memory trade-off is a case where 
	  an algorithm or program trades increased space usage with decreased time.
	  </p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Here, space refers to the data storage consumed in 
	  performing a given task (RAM, HDD, etc), and time refers to the time 
	  consumed in performing a given task (computation time or response time).
	  </p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">The most common situation is an algorithm involving a 
	  lookup table: an implementation can include the entire table, which 
	  reduces computing time, but increases the amount of memory needed, or it 
	  can compute table entries as needed, increasing computing time,but 
	  reducing memory requirements.<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>Hashing</li>
		   <li>&nbsp;Boyer-Moore Algorithm</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h4>Randomized Algorithms</h4>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a 
	  degree of randomness as part of<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">its logic. The algorithm typically uses uniformly 
	  random bits as an auxiliary input to guide<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">its behaviour, in the hope of achieving good 
	  performance in the average case over all<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">possible choices of random bits. </p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Formally, the algorithm's performance will be a 
	  random variable determined by the random bits; thus either the running 
	  time, or the output (or both) are random variables.<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>Skip List</li>
		   <li>Random Binary Trees</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h4>Backtracking</h4>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all 
	  (or some) solutions to some computational problem, that incrementally 
	  builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate 
	  ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that candidate cannot possibly be 
	  completed to a valid solution.<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Backtracking is an important tool for solving 
	  constraint satisfaction problems, such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, 
	  Sudoku, and many other puzzles.<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>N Queen's Problem</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h4>Space and Time trade-off</h4>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">A space–time or time–memory trade-off is a case where 
	  an algorithm or program trades increased space usage with decreased time.
	  </p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Here, space refers to the data storage consumed in 
	  performing a given task (RAM, HDD, etc), and time refers to the time 
	  consumed in performing a given task (computation time or response time).
	  </p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">The most common situation is an algorithm involving a 
	  lookup table: an implementation can include the entire table, which 
	  reduces computing time, but increases the amount of memory needed, or it 
	  can compute table entries as needed, increasing computing time,but 
	  reducing memory requirements.<o:p></o:p></p>

	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>Hashing</li>
		   <li>&nbsp;Boyer-Moore Algorithm</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h4>Randomized Algorithms</h4>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a 
	  degree of randomness as part of<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">its logic. The algorithm typically uses uniformly 
	  random bits as an auxiliary input to guide<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">its behaviour, in the hope of achieving good 
	  performance in the average case over all<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">possible choices of random bits. </p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Formally, the algorithm's performance will be a 
	  random variable determined by the random bits; thus either the running 
	  time, or the output (or both) are random variables.<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>Skip List</li>
		   <li>Random Binary Trees</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h4>Backtracking</h4>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all 
	  (or some) solutions to some computational problem, that incrementally 
	  builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate 
	  ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that candidate cannot possibly be 
	  completed to a valid solution.<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="MsoNormal">Backtracking is an important tool for solving 
	  constraint satisfaction problems, such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, 
	  Sudoku, and many other puzzles.<o:p></o:p></p>
	  <p class="auto-style1">Examples: </p>
	   <ul class="auto-style2">
		   <li>N Queen's Problem</li>
