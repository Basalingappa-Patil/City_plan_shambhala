                            development of renewable energy solutions by integrating robust and innovative
                            infrastructure for solar farms, wind turbines, and energy storage systems. The city’s
                            renewable energy budget of ₹25,000 crore can be strategically utilized to establish smart
                            grids and IoT-enabled energy management systems, ensuring efficient distribution and usage
                            of clean energy. These projects not only build resilient energy infrastructure but also
                            foster industrial growth by attracting green technology companies to Vatsalya’s business
                            hubs. Furthermore, innovation hubs and vocational training centers in the city can focus on
                            advancing renewable energy technologies, creating a skilled workforce and promoting
                            sustainable practices. This synergy between infrastructure resilience and renewable energy
                            adoption will position Vatsalya as a model city for sustainable industrialization and

                One in three people live without sanitation. This is causing unnecessary disease and death. Although huge strides have been made with access to clean drinking water, lack of sanitation is undermining these advances. If we provide affordable equipment and education in hygiene practices, we can stop this senseless suffering and loss of life.

                        <p class="content">SDG 6 has eight targets including two so-called "implementing targets". Six of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the year 2020, and one has no target year.[12] Each of the targets also has one or two indicators which will be used to measure progress. In total there are 11 indicators to monitor progress for SDG6.[13] The main data sources for the SDG 6 targets and indicators come from the Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 coordinated by UN-Water.[4]

                            The six "outcome-oriented targets" include: Safe and affordable drinking water; end open defecation and provide access to sanitation, and hygiene, improve water quality, wastewater treatment and safe reuse, increase water-use efficiency and ensure freshwater supplies, implement IWRM, protect and restore water-related ecosystems. The two "means of achieving" targets are to expand water and sanitation support to developing countries, and to support local engagement in water and sanitation management.[4].</p>

                            impacts, is closely connected to the green urban mobility plans of Vatsalya Nagar. By
                            transitioning to electric buses, bike-sharing programs, and pedestrian-friendly pathways,
                            the city reduces greenhouse gas emissions and minimizes its carbon footprint. These
