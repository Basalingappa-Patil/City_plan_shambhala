			<p class="MsoNormal">Here’s another modern data structure called 
			graphs which has the art of linking life's moments into a beautiful 
			network. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">A Graph is a dynamic and versatile data 
			structure, composed of vertices (nodes) and edges. Unlike the rigid, 
			sequential layout of linear data structures like arrays and linked 
			lists, graphs introduce a web of interconnected pathways. This 
			non-linear design allows multiple routes from one vertex to another, 
			infusing complexity and flexibility essential for diverse 
			applications.<o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Imagine each vertex as a key point and each 
			edge as a bridge connecting these points. This intricate network can 
			model anything from social connections to transportation routes, 
			offering a powerful tool for solving complex problems and 
			visualizing data relationships.</p>

            <h2>Types of Graphs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Directed Graphs:</strong> Edges have a direction, indicating the relationship flows from one vertex to another.</li>
                <li><strong>Undirected Graphs:</strong> Edges do not have a direction, representing a mutual relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>Weighted Graphs:</strong> Edges have weights, which can represent costs, distances, or other quantitative measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Unweighted Graphs:</strong> All edges are equal, with no weights assigned.</li>
