					<p>Since the city is located in the state of Gujarat, there 
					is a possibility of having periodic droughts which could affect 
					several factors of the city like Agricultural productivity, 
					Industrial area, Wildlife sanctuary. This could result as a 
					long term challenge since the water supply is a major problem 
					in the city.</p>
					<p><strong>Possible solution</strong>: The problem could be 
					addressed with a solution by using Divide and Conquer technique 
					and BFS. </p>
					<p>Divide and Conquer: Divide the region into smaller zones, 
					which has its own water needs and sources.</p>
					<p>Solve the problem with techniques like BFS which finds the
