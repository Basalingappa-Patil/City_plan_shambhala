						<p>In a thriving urban environment like Shambhala, efficient 
						inventory management is crucial for both businesses and 
						public services. Effective inventory management ensures 
						that products and resources are available when needed, reducing 
						waste and improving operational efficiency. This system 
						is particularly important for:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Retail Stores: Ensuring shelves are stocked with 
							products in high demand. </li>
							<li>Healthcare Facilities: Maintaining a steady supply 
							of medical supplies and equipment. </li>
							<li>Public Services: Managing resources like emergency 
							supplies, maintenance materials, and utilities. </li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Possible solution: </strong></p>
						<p>The problem could be addressed with a solution by using 
						Sorting Algorithms and Searching algorithms. </p>
						<p>Sorting Algorithms: The use of sorting algorithms, such 
						as Quick Sort or Merge Sort, could be done to organize inventory 
						items based on different attributes like expiration dates, 
						stock levels, or sales frequency. By sorting the inventory 
						efficiently, businesses and public services can easily locate 
						and prioritize items that need immediate attention or replenishment.<br>
						Binary Search: Binary Search can be used to quickly find 
						specific products in a sorted inventory. This ensures that 
						items can be retrieved rapidly, reducing wait times and 
						improving overall operational efficiency. </p>
						<p>Brute Force Search: Brute Force Search can be used to 
						sequentially check each item in the inventory to find specific 
						products. This straightforward method ensures that every 
						element is examined until the desired item is found.</p>
						<p>This could then be integrated as a whole to present as 
						an efficient method to address the problem.</p>
						<p><strong>Related SDG's</strong></p>

							<p>In a thriving urban environment like Shambhala, efficient 
							resource management is crucial for academic institutions. 
							Effective course scheduling ensures that classrooms 
							and study spaces are available when needed, reducing 
							idle times and improving operational efficiency. This 
							system is particularly important for:</p>
							<p><strong>Possible solution: </strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Academic Institutions: Ensuring classrooms and 
								laboratories are allocated efficiently for various 
								courses. </li>
								<li>Students: Reducing schedule conflicts and ensuring 
								they can attend all their courses without clashes.
								</li>
								<li>Administrators: Managing resources like study 
								spaces and ensuring their optimal use.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The problem could be addressed with a solution using 
							Binary Search Tree (BST). </p>
							<p>The use of a BST could be done to organize course 
							schedules based on different attributes like time slots, 
							course duration, or instructor availability. By managing 
							the schedules efficiently, academic institutions can 
							easily locate and prioritize courses that need immediate 
							attention or rescheduling. </p>
							<p>SDG 11.3:
						By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries.<br>
							Target SDG 11.3 - Inclusive and Sustainable Urbanization: 
							By optimizing the allocation of classrooms and study 
							spaces, universities can contribute to sustainable urban 
							development. Efficient scheduling reduces the need for 
							new construction, thereby managing land use more effectively 
							and supporting population growth sustainably.</p>
